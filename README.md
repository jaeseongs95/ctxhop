**Switch devices. Keep your context.**

CtxHop is a local-first CLI for carrying Claude Code and Codex Sessions between
devices. Bind a project, sync its Session records through storage you control,
and resume on any authorized device.

Session Hub groups Agent-native Sessions into logical Sessions, preserves their
source history, and lets you switch Agents by creating a target-native Session
from selected context. Workspace and Git handoff are explicit, while local
encryption and device authorization protect the sync boundary.

> **This fork** (`jaeseongs95/ctxhop`) adds a [Windows
> GUI](#windows-gui-this-fork) for Claude Code and Codex Desktop conversations.
> The CLI installers below come from the upstream project
> [`CCCCY-ci/ctxhop`](https://github.com/CCCCY-ci/ctxhop).

## Key Features

- **Cross-device Session resume**: Continue a project Session on another
  authorized device.
- **Session Hub**: Bring Claude Code and Codex Sessions into one logical
  Session while preserving their native sources and history.
- **Agent switching**: Use `ctxhop session switch` to carry selected context
  into a new native Session for another Agent.
- **Workspace handoff**: Move selected workspace files and Git state with the
  Session when needed.
- **Local-first storage**: Encrypt data on the device and store it in a backend
  you control.

## Demo

## Installation

Download the package for your operating system and CPU architecture from
[Releases](https://github.com/CCCCY-ci/ctxhop/releases).

### Windows

Download and run the installer for your CPU architecture:

- CtxHop-Setup_<version>_windows_amd64.exe
- CtxHop-Setup_<version>_windows_arm64.exe

The installer places CtxHop in `%USERPROFILE%\.ctxhop\bin` and adds that
directory to the current user's PATH. Administrator privileges are not required.
Open a new terminal and verify the installation:

~~~powershell
ctxhop version
~~~

For portable use, download `ctxhop_<version>_windows_<arch>.zip`, extract
`ctxhop.exe`, and add its directory to PATH.

### macOS / Linux

Choose the archive for your platform and CPU architecture:

- macOS Intel: `ctxhop_<version>_darwin_amd64.zip`
- macOS Apple Silicon: `ctxhop_<version>_darwin_arm64.zip`
- Linux x86_64: `ctxhop_<version>_linux_amd64.zip`
- Linux ARM64: `ctxhop_<version>_linux_arm64.zip`

In a terminal, extract and install the archive:

~~~bash
unzip ctxhop_<version>_<os>_<arch>.zip
sh install.sh
~~~

The default installation directory is `$XDG_BIN_HOME` when set, otherwise
`$HOME/.local/bin`. Set `CTXHOP_INSTALL_DIR` to use another user-level
directory:

~~~bash
CTXHOP_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/bin sh install.sh
~~~

If the directory is not on PATH, the installer prints the required shell
configuration. Open a new terminal and verify the installation:

~~~bash
ctxhop version
~~~

### Install with Go (optional)

Requires Go 1.26 or later:

~~~bash
go install github.com/CCCCY-ci/ctxhop/cmd/ctxhop@latest
~~~

Ensure Go's binary directory is on PATH. Replace `@latest` with a release tag
when a pinned version is required.

### Initialize CtxHop

After installing the CLI on any platform:

~~~bash
ctxhop init
~~~

This configures storage, encryption, device identity, and Agent Hooks, then
creates or joins a sync domain.

### Uninstall

~~~bash
ctxhop uninstall
~~~

Uninstalling removes the local CLI, configuration, device keys, state, logs,
and CtxHop-installed Agent Hooks. Remote objects and local directory-backend
data are kept. If the directory backend overlaps the local configuration
directory, move the backend first.

## Quick Start: Cloudflare R2

This quick start uses Cloudflare R2. Other S3-compatible object stores follow
the same steps. Prepare an R2 bucket, its Access Key and Secret Access Key,
and a working copy of the project on both devices.

The commands use the automatically created `default` Hub.

Example R2 configuration:

~~~text
Endpoint: https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
Bucket:   <BUCKET_NAME>
Region:   auto
Prefix:   ctxhop/demo     # optional
~~~

Use the same bucket and prefix on every device in one sync domain.

### 1. Initialize device A

~~~bash
ctxhop init --backend s3 --endpoint "https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com" --bucket "<BUCKET_NAME>" --region "auto" --prefix "ctxhop/demo" --device-name "device-a"
~~~

Follow the prompts for the R2 credentials and encryption password. Leave the
R2 session-token prompt empty when using a standard R2 API token. Store the
**Recovery Key** generated by the first initialization offline.

Choose whether to install Agent Hooks during initialization. Hooks push a
completed Session automatically; use `--no-hook` to skip them.

### 2. Bind the project and push

After completing a Session on device A, run these commands from the project
directory:

~~~bash
cd /path/to/project
ctxhop project bind --path .
ctxhop push
~~~

To include uncommitted workspace files and Git state, use:

~~~bash
ctxhop push --workspace
~~~

### 3. Authorize device B

Create an invitation on device A:

~~~bash
ctxhop device invite --output ctxhop-device-b.json
~~~

Transfer the invitation file to device B, then run:

~~~bash
ctxhop init --invite ./ctxhop-device-b.json --device-name "device-b"
~~~

Use device B's R2 credentials and the same encryption password.

### 4. Restore the Session

Prepare the project working copy on device B and bind it:

~~~bash
cd /path/to/project
ctxhop project bind --path .
ctxhop list
ctxhop resume <SESSION_ID>
~~~

After the restore, continue with the native Agent command:

~~~bash
# Codex
codex resume <SESSION_ID>

# Claude Code
claude --resume <SESSION_ID>
~~~

### Optional: Switch to another Agent

Cross-Agent switching creates a new target-native Session and keeps the source
Session unchanged:

~~~bash
# Preview the switch
ctxhop session switch <SESSION_ID> --to codex --preview

# Create and launch the target Session
ctxhop session switch <SESSION_ID> --to codex --launch
~~~

Use `--to claude-code` to switch to Claude Code.

## Windows GUI (this fork)

[`gui/ctxhop-gui-vnext/`](gui/ctxhop-gui-vnext/) is a Windows GUI that backs up
Claude Code and Codex Desktop conversations from one window and restores them
on another PC. It runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1.

1. Download `CtxHop-GUI-vNext-<date>.zip` from this fork's
   [Releases](https://github.com/jaeseongs95/ctxhop/releases).
2. **Unblock the zip before extracting it**: right-click it, choose
   **Properties**, and check **Unblock**, or run
   `Unblock-File .\CtxHop-GUI-vNext-<date>.zip`. Otherwise Windows blocks the
   extracted scripts and the GUI silently does not open.
3. Extract it and run `ctxhop-gui-vnext\Run-CtxHop-GUI-vNext.cmd`.

- A backup covers one conversation at a time. A Codex Desktop restore previews
  the selected backups first and asks you to choose an action for each item
  (every item defaults to Skip).
- The UI is in Korean or English. Choose one under **Language / 언어** on the
  settings tab, then restart the GUI.
- Codex Desktop transfers use the `ctxhop bundle` command. The release zip
  includes the `bin\ctxhop.exe` and `bin\ctxhop-claude.exe` builds, which the
  GUI pins by SHA-256. Neither is committed to this repository.
- This is a preview. A real round trip between two PCs has not been run yet.

Setup, usage, and recovery steps are in the [GUI
README](gui/ctxhop-gui-vnext/README.en.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **A command fails and the reason is unclear**: run `ctxhop doctor` to check
  the configuration, backend, Agent, project, and Hook state. CtxHop also
  writes a daily log, `logs/ctxhop-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, in the [configuration
  directory](#configuration). A failed command is logged with `result=failed`
  and its error.
- **`ctxhop list` or `ctxhop project bind` reports conflicting project
  bindings**: a parent folder and one of its child folders are bound with
  different identities. Find them with `ctxhop project list`, then remove one
  with `ctxhop project unbind --identity <ID> --path <DIR>`. Unbinding changes
  only the local configuration. Sessions and remote data are kept. If you
  remove the last binding of an identity that used a non-default Hub, choose
  the Hub again (`--hub`) when you bind it again.
- **`ctxhop init` stopped because the passwords did not match or the Recovery
  Key confirmation was wrong**: nothing was saved. Run `ctxhop init` again.
- **You forgot the encryption password**: run `ctxhop passphrase reset` and
  enter the Recovery Key. To change a password you know, run
  `ctxhop passphrase change`.
- **The Windows GUI does not open after you extract the release zip**: delete
  the extracted folder, unblock the zip, and extract it again.
- For other GUI problems, see [Troubleshooting in the GUI
  README](gui/ctxhop-gui-vnext/README.en.md#troubleshooting).

## How It Fits Together

CtxHop uses a simple hierarchy:

~~~text
Domain
└── Hub
    └── Project
        └── Session
            ├── Claude Code native Session / Replica
            └── Codex native Session / Replica
~~~

- **Domain** is the encrypted sync boundary: its Remote namespace, keyfile,
  and authorized devices define one shared data space.
- **Hub** is a logical project space inside a Domain. It groups and isolates
  projects; a new Domain starts with a `default` Hub.
- **Project** is the project-level boundary for workspace, Git state, and Sessions.
- **Session** is the logical development context shared across Agents.

In normal use, Domain and the `default` Hub stay in the background. You work
with the current Project and its Sessions. Use another Hub only when you want
to keep groups of projects separate within the same authorized Domain.

## Synchronized Data

CtxHop synchronizes encrypted Session context and project identity by default.
Workspace files and Git state are included only when `--workspace` is used.
Agent configuration is filtered before synchronization.

| Data | Scope |
|---|---|
| Session context | Synchronized by default. Stored as encrypted Agent session records. |
| Project identity and Git summary | Synchronized by default. Used to match the same project across devices. |
| Agent environment | Filtered components selected during `init`, such as Skills, MCP intents, and allowed Session settings. |
| Workspace and Git state | Optional. Included only with `push --workspace` and `resume --workspace`. |
| Credentials and secrets | Never synchronized. This includes tokens, private keys, authentication files, headers, environment secrets, and `.env` files. |

Project files and complete Git repositories are outside the default
synchronization scope.

## CLI

Run `ctxhop <command> --help` for options. Use `ctxhop help <command> [action]`
to browse the command index. Run `ctxhop` in a terminal for the interactive
workspace; redirected input/output prints the command index. Type to filter,
use the arrow keys to move, and press Enter to run an action. Commands marked
`[--json]` support machine-readable output.

`<HUB>`, `<PROJECT_ID>`, `<SESSION_ID>`, `<REPLICA_ID>`, `<CONTRIBUTION_ID>`,
and `<NATIVE_ID>` are selectors supplied by you.
